# Model-Comparison-for-Heart-Disease-prediction
Machine Learning Project
Evaluated and compared machine learning models: Decision trees (Bagging, Boosting, Random forest), Neural networks, and Logistic regression on 3 different datasets to find the best fit.  
Evaluation metrics included Accuracy, Misclassification error, Cross validation, ROC Curves.
